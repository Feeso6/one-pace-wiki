# Intro
The episode starts with the dropping of Ace's chains. The reason I included this again was to get a neat transition to the title card and
segue to the celebratory music track (He Who Can Not Forgive, Fight!). The upwards panning shot to the sky originally contains the episode title card.
This was removed by stitching the shot into one single image, without the title card,
and then panned manually in Vegas combined with the velocity envelope to retain the same acceleration.

# Newgate's flashback
I'm really glad we managed to cut down Newgate's flashback so that it's almost panel-by-panel to the manga.
The anime oversaturated this scene by adding a bunch of extra scenes from different parts in his life.

# Ace Punch
The original ending after Ace was punched had a non-canon flashback to again explain how the Vivre cards worked (...).
This was cut out completely and we're left with a very quick and fast-paced outro
that includes all the canon panels and takes the viewer by complete surprise.
