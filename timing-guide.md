## Naming
### Devil Fruits
Translated to English, while keeping the double noun, like Rubber-Rubber Fruit. The hyphen is always present in the name of the fruit and attack. Furthermore, while Japanese names are translated, exceptions are made for specifically Japanese attacks such as Zoro's Onigiri or Katakuri's Mochi.

## Grammar
### Sentence spacing
Replace all sentence spaces with normal spaces (Ctrl+H "  " -> " ").

### Honorifics
All honorifics should be italicized.

### Ellipses
Lines ending with ellipses (...) must not continue the ellipsis on the following line.

Correct:
`"My name is..."` / `"Luffy!"`

Incorrect:
`"My name is..."` / `"... Luffy!"`

### Attacks
Attack fades are `150ms` long and should end in an exclamation mark, depending on the vocal exclamation: `{\fad(150,150)}Rubber-Rubber Balloon!`

If there is a pause in the attack, split the line into two, ending the first line in an ellipsis.

Both lines should have fading.

Note that this is only for attack lines that don't use karaoke effects.

## Aegisub Styles
- Main: The default style.
- Secondary: When two characters are talking over each other, the less apparent dialog uses this style.
- Flashbacks:  For short flashbacks, when the voice has an echo or similar indicating that it's a flashback.
- Thoughts: For dialog where the character is thinking the line.
- Captions: For infoboxes, signs, etc.
- Note: For TL notes and other notes. Appears on top so it can be used in conjunction with other lines.
- Title: Title card text (HD only).
- Title2: Title card text (SD only).
- Credits: Opening credits.
- Narrator: For when the narrator is speaking.

## Special characters
- Hyphen/Dash/Minus: `-`
- Apostrophe: `'`
- Quotation: `" "`
- (Back)slash: `\ /`
- Other: ```!%&()=¤#@£$€{[]}´`€~^|<>*+```

## Formatting and standards
- Words: Primarily US English (Color, Meter, Gray, Cookie, Theater etc.)
- Numbers: 10,500,000.00 (not "10 million 500 thousand" or "10 million 500 thousand point zero")
- Measurement system: Metric
- Time: 12-hour clock

## Other guidelines
- Lines may never be over two rows. Lines that exceed two rows should be rephrased or split into two.
