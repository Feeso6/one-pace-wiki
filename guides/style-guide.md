# 1. Grammar
## 1.1. Naming convention
With the exception of certain attacks, we generally translate everything into English unless it is a name. This means that popular phrases like Nakama will be replaced with something like crewmate, friend or comrade. See the list below for a more detailed breakdown of what we use for more disputed translations.

### 1.1.1. Guiding principles
#### 1.1.1.1. Adding terms
1. The Manga's romanizations take the highest priority, unless disliked by a majority for reasons other than being accustomed to another term. If the Manga has differing spellings, the more recent and the more prevalent spelling takes precedence.
2. Databooks, vivre cards, and Jump take the second priority.
3. The anime, official English translations such as Viz, Funimation, Fan translations, or our own Romanization are third priority.

#### 1.1.1.2. Updating terms
Unless unanimously agreed, a term can not be changed in the style guide if the first episode it was used in was released more than one year ago, and/or has been used in more than four instances.

### 1.1.2. Devil Fruits
Translated to English, while keeping the double noun, like Rubber-Rubber Fruit. The hyphen is always present in the name of the fruit and attack. Furthermore, while Japanese names are translated, exceptions are made for specifically Japanese attacks such as Zoro's Onigiri or Katakuri's Mochi.

- Chop-Chop Fruit
- Flame-Flame Fruit
- Flower-Flower Fruit
- Magma-Magma Fruit
- Memo-Memo Fruit
- Mochi-Mochi Fruit
- Rubber-Rubber Fruit

### 1.1.8. Abilities
We do not translate attack names if they are in a language other than Japanese. E.G. We keep Sanji's and Robin's moves as they are. We also do not translate a move name if a literal translation ruins a reference. E.G. Zoro's "Two-Swords Style Rashomon" attack is a reference to a gate of the same name in Kyoto and a famous movie.

## 1.3. Honorifics
All honorifics are italicized, along with the associated dash.

## 1.4. Ellipses
Lines ending with ellipses (...) must not continue the ellipsis on the following line.

* Correct: `"My name is..."` / `"Luffy!"`
* Incorrect: `"My name is..."` / `"... Luffy!"`

## 1.5. Attacks
### 1.5.1. Fading
*Note: Only relevant to attacks that don't use Karaoke Effects.*

Attack fades are **150 milliseconds** long and should end in an exclamation mark, depending on the vocal exclamation. Example: `{\fad(150,150)}Rubber-Rubber Balloon!`. If there is a pause in the attack, split the line into two, ending the first line in an ellipsis. Both lines should have fading.

## 1.6. Character set
These are the only acceptable characters that can be used in an Aegisub script:
```abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789 -.,;:¨'"/!%&()#´`+```

# 2. Standards
## 2.1. Language
The primary language is U.S. English, mixed with occassional loaned words from Japanese depending on the situation.

## 2.2. Numbers
The number format to follow is `10,500,000.00`.
- Thousand separator: `,`
- Decimal separator: `.`

## 2.3. Others
Note: We generally do not subtitle onomatopoeia. 
- Measurement: Metric
- Time: 12-hour clock (AM/PM)
- Temperature: Celsius

# 3. Styling
## 3.1. Aegisub Styles
- Main: The default style.
- Secondary: When two characters are talking over each other, the less apparent dialog uses this style.
- Flashbacks:  For short flashbacks, when the voice has an echo or similar indicating that it's a flashback.
- Thoughts: For dialog where the character is thinking the line.
- Captions: For infoboxes, signs, etc.
- Note: For TL notes and other notes. Appears on top so it can be used in conjunction with other lines.
- Title: Title card text (HD only).
- Title2: Title card text (SD only).
- Credits: Opening credits.
- Narrator: For when the narrator is speaking.

## 3.2. Credits
These are the official names of the different roles and credits for the openings:
- Editing/Editor
- Quality Control/QC
- Translation/Translator
- Timing/Timer
- Visual Effects/Visual Effects Artist
- Graphics/Graphics Artist
- Karaoke/K-Timer
- Soundtracking/Soundtracker
- Raws/Raw Provider

# 4. Practices
## 4.1. Lines
1. Lines may never be over two rows. Lines that exceed two rows should be rephrased or split into two.
2. Each line may only contain one character's dialog. If multiple characters are speaking at the same time, use the Secondary style.

## 4.2. Infoboxes
### 4.2.1. Dialogue
1. For dialogue during infoboxes and captions, if the dialogue line is one line, put it under the infobox with vertical alignment `0`.
2. If the dialogue line is two lines. Place it at the top with `\an8`.

### 4.2.2. Captions
1. Captions are to use the `Captions` style (See above).
2. For character infoboxes that are placed bottom centre, put the captions above the infobox, closely matching the line breaks and the font sizes in the Japanese text inside the infobox.
3. For location infoboxes, make sure the caption fits horizontally within the infobox, then place it either above or below the infobox (never to the side). Make sure the font size and line breaks match the Japanese text inside the infobox.

## 4.3 Italics
Some lines sometimes have wrapped italics (Especially thoughts). Make sure to remove these since the Thoughts style itself manages styling such as italics. To remove wrapped italics in Aegisub, select the lines with the wrapped Italics and press Ctrl+H. Tick "Use regular expressions" and "Limit to Selected Rows", and in the "Find what" textbox, input this regex: `(^\{\\i(1|0)?\}|\{\\i(1|0)?\}$)`.
