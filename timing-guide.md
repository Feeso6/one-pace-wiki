# 1. Grammar
## 1.1. Naming convention
1) We only consider an update for the names if the pronunciation/ meaning changes.
2) Recent Oda is king unless a loud majority hate it (not mildly prefer or are used to another spelling).
3) If there is enough hate, we look to the anime, Jump, official English versions for alternatives or come up with our own if we can't find a good one.
