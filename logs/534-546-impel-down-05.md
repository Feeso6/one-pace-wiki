## 5:13 - Silence, Magellan
In the original episode, Magellan had a line here to increase his intimidation.
Since this was not in the manga it was removed.
The sound effect was inserted from the corresponding dub episode, by isolating and removing the voice track, made possible with the 5.1 audio.
The background music track was inserted in the regular manner, by matching the volume and the track position.
